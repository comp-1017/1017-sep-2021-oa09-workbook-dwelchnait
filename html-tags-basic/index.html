             "block" group of tags places your content on a new line-->
            <p>
                The paragraph tag s a block tag. A block tag begins a new line in your 
                diplayed web page on the browser. The browser does NOT display your content 
                in the physical style of how you have entered your code in your html file.
            </p>
            <p>This is my second paragraph on the displayed browser page. It will start a 
                new line.
            </p>
            <!--if you wish to use a component of a reserved tag (or the
                whole tag) you would be in trouble using the tag
                instead: you can use special character strings to 
                represent components of the tag such as the < (&lt;) and
                the > (&gt;) symbols-->
